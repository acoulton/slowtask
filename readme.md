# SlowTask library
(c) 2011 Andrew Coulton - released under the Kohana Licence

The SlowTask module provides a simple API to allow long running processes to
run in the background and provide the web user with feedback on progress and
the opportunity to abort the task.

For usage examples, see the userguide docs or the 
[slowtask-demo app](https://github.com/acoulton/slowtask-demo) (or read the source!)
